;I
;
; This is an Infinite-tape Turing Machine.
;
; It inverts a binary string (0s become 1s, 1s become 0s).
; It assumes the head starts on the first symbol of the string.
; The machine halts when it finds the first blank.
;
; The start state is 0.

; State 0: "Invert and Move Right"

; If we see a 0, write 1, move right, stay in state 0
0 0 1 r 0

; If we see a 1, write 0, move right, stay in state 0
0 1 0 r 0

; If we see a blank, we are done. Halt.
0 _ _ * halt
